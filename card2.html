                <h2>Binge Eating</h2>
                <p>Does this sound like you — able to control your portions sometimes but losing control and uncontrollably eating large amounts of food at other times? This is called "binge eating" and lots of people do it.</p>
                <p>A binge is when you eat a lot of food in a short time and it's usually not healthy food. Binge eating is bad for you, especially if you have diabetes.</p>
                <h2>Emotional Eating</h2>
                <p>Many people eat when they are feeling upset, angry, stressed, sad, lonely or fearful. Emotions such as these can be powerful triggers to eat.</p>
                <p>If you're an emotional eater, you can learn other ways to react to your emotions. Emotions usually don't last long — often just 10 minutes to an hour — so you only need to distract yourself from eating for a short time, until the emotion passes. Try going for a brisk walk around the block or doing some yoga.</p>
                <h2>Nighttime Eating</h2>
                <p>For many people, dinner is only the start of their nighttime eating. There's nothing wrong with a healthy snack such as fruit, plain popcorn or whole-wheat toast with a little peanut butter a couple of hours after dinner. However, nighttime eating is a problem when you eat large amounts of food or foods high in saturated fat, sodium and calories like cookies, chips, full-fat ice cream, sandwiches or leftovers.</p>
                <p>If nighttime eating is a problem for you, try to eat most of your calories during daylight hours. Reach for a light, healthy snack in the evening.</p>

                <h2>To help control binge, emotional and nighttime eating:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get into the habit of eating three healthy meals a day — breakfast, lunch and dinner — so you never get too hungry.</li>
                    <li>Don't keep binge foods at home. If you're a binge eater, you know which foods you usually reach for. Common binge foods are cookies, candy, ice cream or chips.</li>
                    <li>Make a list of other things you'll do. Here are some suggestions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a walk or enjoy another physical activity.</li>
                            <li>Talk to a friend who can help you get your feelings under control.</li>
                            <li>Do something you enjoy, like reading, playing or listening to music, playing with pets or children, arts and crafts, or taking a relaxing bath.</li>
                            <li>Do some physical work, such as gardening or housecleaning.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If these behaviors become regular occurrences, talk with your healthcare provider about what you can do.</p>
